##### Step 0
Create new working directory if it does not exist. Download zip file and set directory locations for input files
##### Step 1
Load reference data about acitivity lables
##### Step 2 
 Load test activity data. Assign activity label to test data
##### Step 3
Load training activity data. Assign activity label to training data
##### Step 4
Load training data. Load the feature labels. Assign feature lables to the training data frame. Load training subject data. Add new column "subject" to training data set. Add new column "activity" to above train data set.
##### Step 5
Load test data. Load the feature labels. Assign feature lables to the test data frame. Load test subject data. Add new column "subject" to test data set. Add new column "activity" to test data set.
##### Step 6
Merge training and test data set

Extract only mean and std for each measure so extarct these measure names and also subject as we need it later. Now extract only select columns/measures from the consolidated final dataset.
##### Step 8
Assign descriptive names to filtered data set created in step above
##### Step 8
Fnally create final data set using the filteredDataset, split it by 'subject,activity', use this split SubData i.e. .SD, apply the mean function
##### Step 10
Write the dataset in tidydataset.txt




# select all rows so second argument is TRUE
